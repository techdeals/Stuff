Spike Strips V for FiveM 

The DLL labeled Debug Draws 3D lines on the spike strips as well as the currently tracked vehicle for testing the plugin

The Other Version Does not.

If you choose to use the debug version it is included. just replace the SpikeV.net.dll with that one (make a backup copy though incase you want to use the non debug version!)
