### whitelist section, add one or more player identifiers below to allow that player to join when the whitelist is enabled.
### you don't need to use ALL identifiers, just using 1 is enough, but I added all of them below just as an example on how to use
### the different types of identifiers. All players that are NOT on this list will not be allowed in if the whitelist is enabled.
