  # RegionRememberOptional
  # 
  # Remembers if players disables the Region-GameMode (by switching in an
  # optional region to World-Default-GameMode with /lc creative|survival). So

  # RegionSafeMode
  # 
  # When a player leaves a region he always will get back to the World-GameMode,

  # string are blocked, even if more parameteres are entered by the user.
  # If the first character is ^ the entry is interpreted as a regular expression
  # (including the ^ for begin of the string).

  # default: false

  # BlockStateThreading
  # 
  # Uses Threading to minimize lag. This fully relies on Bukkit metadata
  # implementation. You only should need this,
  # if there are often plays more then 10 players at once on your server, or

  # Be aware that this requires more memory, to increase the performance
  # 
  # Without threading, huge WorldEdits becomes much noticeable slower.

  # 
  # While you may use per world permissions to configure limitations fine

  # (like complete creative worlds) to save cpu and memory.
  # 
  # default: []
  ignoredWorlds: []
  
  # BlockStateWorldEditIntegration
  # 
  # Allows you to disable hook into WorldEdit for better Performance. By default
  # Integration is enable, so it logs block modifications via worldedit as
  # creative-placed blocks in the database.
  # A server reload (better restart) is needed to disabled WE-Integration.
  # 
  # default: true
  worldeditIntegration: true

# Metrics
# 
# This settings allows the Addon-Author to track the Servers using this plugin.
# It will not track any player related data like names, ips, online time or
# such. Please do not disable the option! As more servers are using the plugin
# and the author knows, as more he is willing to support the plugin! Its a
# win-win for both.
